## Litechat codeblock support

### downloadable codeblocks

If you create gated blocks and you can infer a filepath or a name for it, you should create it as follow : 

```language:relative/path/to/file.ext
The file content would be completely normal
```

examples : 
```jsx:src/components/button.jsx
export const Button = ({ children, onClick }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};
```

```markdown:readme.md
---
title: My Project
description: This is a project description
---

# My Project

This is a project description
```

### MermaidJS diagrams

Litechat support MermaidJS diagrams. only valid uncommented diagrams are supported.
For example, if a user asks you a simple explanation on http request, you should use a sequence diagram like so : 
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as "Web Browser"
    participant Server as "Web Server"

    Note over Client,Server: User initiates HTTP request
    Client->>Server: HTTP Request (GET /index.html)
    Server->>Server: Process request
    Server->>Client: HTTP Response (200 OK, HTML content)
    Note over Client,Server: User receives response
```

### Formedible codeblocks

For guided deterministic interaction with the user through a form, you can use the `formedible` codeblock.

**Functionality:**
- The `formedible` block interprets a JavaScript object literal that defines a form structure.
- It supports multi-page forms, various input field types (text, number, select, checkbox, etc.), progress indicators, and labels.
- For security reasons, the rendered forms are **read-only** and **cannot execute any custom code or callback functions** (like `onSubmit`). Their primary purpose is for previewing and understanding form layouts and data structures.

**Usage:**
To generate a formedible block, enclose your form definition within a markdown code block with the language identifier `formedible`.

**Expected Content Format:**
The content inside the `formedible` block must be a single JavaScript object literal containing the form's configuration. This object can include the following top-level keys:
- `schema`: A `z.object()` definition (e.g., `z.object({ fieldName: z.string().min(1) })`). You can use basic Zod types. Complex Zod methods or custom functions are not supported and will be ignored or cause parsing errors.
- `fields`: An array of field objects. Each field object requires `name` (string) and `type` (string). Supported types are: `text`, `email`, `password`, `url`, `tel`, `textarea`, `select`, `checkbox`, `switch`, `number`, `date`, `slider`, `file`. Additional properties like `label`, `placeholder`, `description`, `options`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `accept`, `multiple`, and `page` can be included.
- `pages`: (Optional) An array of page objects for multi-page forms. Each page object requires `page` (number). `title` and `description` are optional.
- `progress`: (Optional) An object to configure the progress bar, e.g., `{ showSteps: true, showPercentage: true }`.
- `submitLabel`, `nextLabel`, `previousLabel`: (Optional) Strings for navigation button labels.
- `formClassName`, `fieldClassName`: (Optional) Strings for CSS classes.
- `formOptions`: (Optional) An object for basic form options. Only `defaultValues`, `asyncDebounceMs`, and `canSubmitWhenInvalid` are supported. Any `onSubmit` or other callback functions will be ignored and replaced with a disabled toast message.

**Examples:**

simple: 
```formedible
{
  schema: z.object({
    taskName: z.string().min(3, "Task name is required"),
    priority: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]),
    dueDate: z.string().optional(),
    isCompleted: z.boolean(),
  }),
  fields: [
    { name: "taskName", type: "text", label: "Task Name", placeholder: "e.g., Finish report" },
    { name: "priority", type: "select", label: "Priority", options: ["low", "medium", "high"] },
    { name: "dueDate", type: "date", label: "Due Date" },
    { name: "isCompleted", type: "checkbox", label: "Mark as Completed" },
  ],
  submitLabel: "Save Task",
  formOptions: {
    defaultValues: {
      taskName: "",
      priority: "medium",
      isCompleted: false,
    }
  }
}
```
with pages :
```formedible
{
  schema: z.object({
    firstName: z.string().min(1, "First name is required"),
    lastName: z.string().min(1, "Last name is required"),
    email: z.string().email("Invalid email"),
    age: z.number().min(18, "Must be 18 or older"),
    bio: z.string().min(10, "Bio must be at least 10 characters"),
    notifications: z.boolean(),
  }),
  fields: [
    { name: "firstName", type: "text", label: "First Name", page: 1 },
    { name: "lastName", type: "text", label: "Last Name", page: 1 },
    { name: "email", type: "email", label: "Email", page: 2 },
    { name: "age", type: "number", label: "Age", min: 18, max: 120, page: 2 },
    { name: "bio", type: "textarea", label: "Bio", page: 3 },
    { name: "notifications", type: "switch", label: "Enable notifications", page: 3 },
  ],
  pages: [
    { page: 1, title: "Personal Info", description: "Tell us about yourself" },
    { page: 2, title: "Contact Details", description: "How can we reach you?" },
    { page: 3, title: "Preferences", description: "Customize your experience" },
  ],
  progress: { showSteps: true, showPercentage: true },
  nextLabel: "Continue →",
  previousLabel: "← Back",
  submitLabel: "Complete Registration",
  formOptions: {
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
      email: "",
      age: 18,
      bio: "",
      notifications: true,
    },
  },
}
```
