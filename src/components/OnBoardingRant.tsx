      <p>Oh, hey ?! Hi there !! How are you doing !?</p>
      <p>
        Nice of you to pop by to checkout LiteChat ! What'd you mean you don't
        know what LiteChat is ? Oh Boy hey, you in for a treat !
      </p>
      <p>
        To start with, it's an(other) AI chat app (yes...) ! But, it is also a
        library, so you can go on and create your own, AI chat app ! (are AI
        chat apps the new JS frameworks ?)
      </p>
      <p>
        And cause I might be a wee bit on the reluctant side when it comes to
        parting with my coins, it doesn't require no servers ! It all stays in
        your browser
      </p>
      <p>
        (that means I couldn't snoop on what you do here, even if I wanted to !)
      </p>
      <p>
        While able to run LLM both local (did I tell you I ain't liking throwing
        coins out ?) and from remote providers (but sometimes you have to :(..)
        !
